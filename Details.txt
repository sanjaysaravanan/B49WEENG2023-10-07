  0. How to run an existing React codes in Github
    1. Copy the repo url
    2. run **git clone <rep-url>** in a clean folder
    3. cd <project-name>
    4. npm install
    5. npm run dev --> might differ depending script used in the repo

  1. What is hook?
      Sort of hooking to the VDOM, controls the rendering VDOM
      
      Eg: useState --> helps in re-rendering whenever any changes in the state happens.
       useState --> Help creating state variable

  2. State vs Props:
        Props ---> static values passed during rendering
        Eg:
          <Todo isCompleted={false} lastDate={'2023-01-01'}  />
          isCompleted, lastDate props

        State --> a value changes causing the re-rendering
          <Counter initialValue={10} />, initialValue ---> prop

          count value that changes inside the component is called state

  3. Reusable Components:
      Trying to re-reuse the parts of the 

      Always look for commanalities in the design and write resusable components with same props 

  4. Component Life Cycle:

      Initialization: JS Loads the JSX into the memory

      Mounting: JSX gets loaded into the RealDOM

      Updating: Some contents or state gets updated in the RealDOM

      Unmounting: Removign the element from the RealDOM

  5. Life Cycle Hook - useEffect

      We are gonna target each of the phases and we are going to do something in those phases( Mounting, Updating, Unmounting )

      Mounted: useEffect with Mounted

  

Next Session:

  1. Updating & Unmounting

  2. Passing data from child to parent component

  7. Passing Dynamic Data to Components

  8. Props drilling
